# Dev Log 4 6/4/2022

Yesterday I was able to update a local user's favorite pokemon with a dynamic icon. It was very challenging but I'm satisfied with the work I got done and it opens the door to do more stuff today.

Today my goal is tidy up some of the code base by adding commments, adding documentation to the readme and getting presentation materials ready.

When it came to styling It took me quite a while to learn the MUI theme system and apply it to my project. I think a lot of the css requires some knowledge of the inner workings of react so changing specific parts of certain components wasn't working for me. I had to resort to just using `document.body.style.backgroundColor` which was just a blanket css rule.







- Other goals:
  1. style the pages (learn MUI themes)
  2. reformat the data so the page loads faster
  3. watch previous project presentations and think about questions
  4. tidy up wireframe?
  5. create slide deck
  6.
